A implementation of a deep neural decision tree from the 2018 paper by Yang et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06988v1.pdf)
Our model matches or surpasses the performance of the original paper on all datasets tested, and we look into tuning hyperparameters and some auxilliary results that the original paper did not fully investigate.
Required Packages: PyTorch, MatPlot, Pandas, SKlearn, Statistics
